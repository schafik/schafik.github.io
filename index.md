I am a Senior Research Fellow at the [Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose], University College London. My [research] is inspired by the age-old question and notion of ‘living and doing good’ (*eudaimonia*), focusing on purpose-driven organisations often rooted in sacred traditions. 

In particular, I study the role of these organizations in delivering services to, taking on societal challenges for, and shaping the business and wider socio-economic environment of their communities. My approach to research is interdisciplinary, combining organisational theory, comparative management and administration, innovation policy, and (uneven) development. I have a strong interest in qualitative, specifically field-based research methods (currently organising my [fieldwork photos]). 

I pursued my graduate studies (Ph.D. and M.A.) in Comparative Administration and Technology Governance from the [Nurkse Department of Innovation and Governance] at Tallinn University of Technology. I hold a B.A. in International Relations and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to joining UCL, I was Lab Manager of the [Center for Decision Sciences] at Columbia Business School. 

Thanks for visiting!
