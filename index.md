I am Senior Research Fellow at the [Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose] at University College London. My [research] is inspired by the age-old question and notion of ‘living and doing good’ or السعادة القصوى (*eudaimonia*). I study the pursuit and understanding of public value creation beyond a global-Western paradigm, focusing on purpose-driven indigenous institutions rooted in religious traditions. 

In particular, I explore the role of these institutions in delivering public services to, taking on challenges for, and shaping the business and wider socio-economic environment of their communities. My approach to research is interdisciplinary, combining non-Western public policy and administration, organisational studies, the commons, technology governance, and ethnographic fieldwork.

Prior to joining UCL faculty, I received my PhD from the [Nurkse Department of Innovation and Governance] at Tallinn University of Technology in 2020, and was a Lab Manager of the [Center for Decision Sciences] at Columbia Business School. See my [CV] for more.
